How to Build

__Installing Node Modules__

After downloading the source code from GitHub and configuring NPM and Grunt, you'll need to navigate to the root directory of the source tree, where package.json and Gruntfile.js are located.  From there, run the command ```npm install``` to pull in all the necessary node modules.  This will generate the node_modules folder.
